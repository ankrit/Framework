1..drop....
  SQL DROP Statement: The SQL DROP command is used to remove an object from the database.
 If you drop a table, all the rows in the table is deleted and the table structure is removed from the database.

The SQL TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to remove all records from a table. It performs the same function as a DELETE statement without a WHERE clause.
 Warning: If you truncate a table, the TRUNCATE TABLE statement can not be rolled back in some databases.

note...
Truncate is normally ultra-fast, ideal for cleaning out data from a temporary table. It does preserve the structure of the table for future use.

If you actually want to remove the table definitions as well as the data, simply drop the tables.

If you truncate the table, MySQL doesn't free the space of the hard disk. If you want your storage back, you should drop the table without truncating it




DROP Table...........................
DROP TABLE [table_name];
The DROP command is used to remove a table from the database. It is a DDL command.
 All the rows, indexes and privileges of the table will also be removed. DROP operation cannot be rolled back.

DELETE Table..........................
DELETE FROM [table_name]
WHERE [condition];

DELETE FROM [table_name];
The DELETE command is a DML command. It can be used to delete all the rows or some rows from the table based on the condition specified in WHERE clause.
 It is executed using a row lock, each row in the table is locked for deletion. 
It maintain the transaction log, so it is slower than TRUNCATE. DELETE operations can be rolled back.

TRUNCATE Table............................
TRUNCATE TABLE [table_name];
The TRUNCATE command removes all rows from a table. It won't log the deletion of each row, instead it logs the deallocation of the data pages of the table,
 which makes it faster than DELETE.
 It is executed using a table lock and whole table is locked for remove all records. It is a DDL command. TRUNCATE operations cannot be rolled back.
